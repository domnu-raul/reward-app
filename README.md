# Reward App
This was a project I worked on for a competition at .msg. The task was to develop a full-stack web application using Spring, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, and React/Angular.
Unfortunately, after working too much on the backend, I got stuck working on the front-end and the project was left unfinished.

# Purpose
The application serves as a method for promoting and rewarding recycling. A list of recycling centers is provided to the users, which may be filtered and searched through based on location, hours open, or the materials accepted.
The user may submit a contribution(recycling) containing the material type, recycling center, and the quantity along with the measurment used(depends on the material). The user gets reward points for contributions, which they can spend on vouchers.

# Current State
The backend provides an API that the client can use to provide the functionalities listed above.
